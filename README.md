# ExperimentalSetup_SpringModel
A Matlab script that visualises our validation of the Experimental Setup approach

Execution of the script [`calibration.m`](calibration.m) produces a folder with the current timestamp as name.
The folder contains a .html file and a SVG figures.
Additionally .m files are created which contain the values to be set in the experimental setups.

This script was created to support the publication  
`The Experiment Model and Validity Frame in M&S` by  
J. Denil, S. Klikovits, P.J. Mosterman, A. Vallecillo and H. Vangheluwe.
